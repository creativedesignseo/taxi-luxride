## [1.4.9] - 2026-01-05

### UI Polish
- **Mobile Experience**: Reduced the top margin of the Home Booking Form to `16px` (`mt-4`) to bring it visually closer to the header, making it the primary focal point.
- **Visual Stability**: Applied `min-h-screen` to the Booking Form container to ensure a "solid" background without gaps.
- **Stacking Logic**: Added `z-index: 50` to the global Footer to ensure it properly covers the fixed map at the bottom of the scroll.

## [1.4.8] - 2026-01-05

### UI Polish
- **Mobile Experience**: Extended the Booking Form height to `min-h-screen` to prevent background gaps (map appearing) when scrolling to the very bottom on taller mobile screens.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed
